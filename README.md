The limited stability and repeatability of metal AM processes represent a major barrier for the industrial breakthrough of metal AM systems. Meanwhile, by in-situ monitoring of the image data in the AM process, it becomes possible to quick detect the defects and unstable conditions, adapt and even correct the process for zero-defect AM. For example, a hot-spot is a local over-heating caused by diminished heat flux towards surrounding materials. The conventional statistical methods have indicated that the location plays a crucial role on the hotspot formation, but only few take temporal features into account. Consider the hotspot located in the corner and edge, it is expected that the corner position should have a higher chance of hotspots than the edge. For time variation, it is also expected that overtime heating tend to occur more hotspots. Further, locations and time themselves may be both auto-correlated and cross-correlated. Therefore, due to the limited resources and high cost of AM process, it is important to accurately identify the location and time simultaneously that are likely to cause hotspots.
